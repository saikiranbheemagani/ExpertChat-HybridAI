# Hybrid Expert Chatbot

**Hybrid Expert Chatbot** is an intelligent, interactive system designed to provide personalized career guidance using a combination of rule-based logic and machine learning models. It simulates the behavior of a human career counselor by asking the user about their educational background, work experience, and preferences—and then analyzing those inputs to recommend optimal career paths.

The chatbot is built with a hybrid approach:
- A **rule-based expert system** for foundational domain logic.
- A **machine learning model** that enhances predictions based on real user data.

## 🧭 Problem Statement

In a world flooded with career options and evolving job roles, individuals—especially students and early professionals—often struggle to find the most suitable path that aligns with their background, strengths, and aspirations. Generic job portals or test-based aptitude assessments usually lack personalization and context-awareness.

**Hybrid Expert Chatbot** bridges this gap by combining the reasoning capabilities of an expert system with the adaptability of machine learning. The result is a system that not only mimics domain expertise but also learns and improves with time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To simulate a **career counselor** through a conversational chatbot interface.
- To create a **hybrid system** using rule-based reasoning and supervised learning.
- To recommend **personalized career paths** based on user input.
- To **log user interactions** for model retraining and analysis.
- To ensure the system is **scalable and adaptable** to evolving domains.

## ✨ Key Features

### 💬 Interactive Career Chatbot
- Engages with users through a command-line interface.
- Asks questions about educational qualifications, skills, interests, and experience.
- Parses responses to extract structured data for processing.

### 📚 Rule-Based Expert System
- Matches user responses against pre-defined rules and job role criteria.
- Ensures baseline accuracy and domain expertise without needing training data.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Uses a trained classifier (e.g., decision tree or logistic regression) to predict suitable career roles.
- Learns from user logs and feedback, improving recommendation quality over time.
- Model is saved as `hybrid_model.pkl`.

### 🧾 Explanation Engine
- Provides **explanations for recommendations**, increasing transparency and user trust.
- Displays reasoning such as: _"You are suited for Data Science because you have a background in Mathematics and an interest in AI."_.

### 📈 Logging System
- Stores every user interaction in `user_interaction_log.csv` for analytics and feedback loops.
- These logs can be used to retrain the model and enhance rule precision.
